# Trace-SM
Download the latest release: [Trace-SM.ps1]({{ site.latestDownloadLink }}/Trace-SM.ps1)   

## Description
Trace-SM.ps1 can be used to collect trace files which will be used by Microsoft Support in troubleshooting. Usually, instructions will be provided by the Microsoft support engineer.

## Purpose
To easily collect (start/stop) and format SCSM specific traces. 

## How to run
1. Save the script Trace-SM.ps1 on a machine where any SCSM component is installed.
1. Open a Windows PowerShell window as an Administrator (PowerShell ISE can also be used).
1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the script.
2. Run the script as below:  
   .\Trace-SM.ps1

## Parameters
*-TraceOperation* (optional)  
  - *ShowStatus* -> this is the default operation, shows current trace status.
  - *Start* -> starts traces. Stops them if already running and moves them to a new subfolder.
  - *Stop* -> stops traces.
  - *StopAndFormat* -> stops traces and then starts formatting them.
</br></br>
  
*-MaxFileSizeMB* (optional, only effective with the Start operation)
  - Can be set to a numeric value in MBytes. Default is 100 MB.  
</br></br>
  
*-NewFileWhenMaxsizeReached* (optional, only effective with the Start operation)
  - Default is circular file tracing. Old trace info is overridden when max file size is reached.  
  When this switch is provided then old trace info will be retained because a new trace file will be created everytime when max file size is reached.  
</br></br>
  
*-Areas* (optional)
  - If not set, the default is to trace all "areas" which are Default, SDK, ConsoleUI, Connectors, DataWarehouse, Workflows, PortalSSP, Performance. To start only specific areas provide their names as comma delimited.

## Examples
- ### To show current trace status
```
.\Trace-SM.ps1
```
or
```
.\Trace-SM.ps1 ShowStatus
```
or
```
.\Trace-SM.ps1 -TraceOperation ShowStatus
