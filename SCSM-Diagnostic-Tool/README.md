## How to contribute?

- Small changes in the UI: 
  - Directly edit a file. 
  - A fork will be created (if not already). 
  - Send your changes with a pull request.

- Making changes locally: 
  - Fork the repo (if not already). 
  - Clone your forked repo.
  - Open "SourceCode/main.ps1" in an elevated PowerShell ISE.
  - Open other files where you want to make changes, edit, set breakpoints, etc.
  - Always start debugging (F5) in file main.ps1.
  - If you want, run "Build/Start_Build_ToLocalDebug.ps1" to create the final SCSM-Diagnostic-Tool.ps1 in the LocalDebug folder and test it locally (Right/Click + Run with PowerShell). Note: LocalDebug folder will be created automatically.
  - If you want, you can also debug that final SCSM-Diagnostic-Tool.ps1 file in an elevated ISE.
  - When done, push your changes and then send a pull request.
  
  Note that, changes must be done in files under the SourceCode folder. 

The final SCSM-Diagnostic-Tool.ps1 file will be generated by the repo owners during a new Release generation.
